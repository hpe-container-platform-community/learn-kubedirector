## Deploying KD clusters

We will start by deploying a Ubuntu cluster.  

First we need to reduce the memory of the cluster so that it runs easily in our lab VM.

Using the LAB UI file browser, open `deploy/example_clusters/cr-cluster-ubuntu18.04.yaml`

Change the definition of to change both instances of `memory: "4Gi"` to `memory: "1Gi"`:

import myImageUrl from '../../static/img/lab_ui_edit_ubuntu.png';

<img src={myImageUrl}/>


In the Lab Browser UI open a new terminal and run: 

```
kubectl create -f deploy/example_clusters/cr-cluster-ubuntu18.04.yaml
```

This should report the following:

```
kubedirectorcluster.kubedirector.hpe.com/ubuntu18.04 created
```

## Listing KD clusters

We can run the following to list the KubeDirector clusters:

```
kubectl get KubeDirectorCluster
```

:::info Use your TAB!

kubectl has been set up to have TAB completion - use it!
TAB completion will save you a lot of typing. For example:

```
kubectl get k<<TAB>>
kubectl get kubedirector<<TAB>><<TAB>>
kubedirectorapps.kubedirector.hpe.com      kubedirectorclusters.kubedirector.hpe.com  kubedirectorconfigs.kubedirector.hpe.com
kubectl get kubedirectorcl<<TAB>>
kubectl get kubedirectorclusters.kubedirector.hpe.com<<ENTER>>
```
:::

Which should return something like the following:

```
NAME          AGE
ubuntu18.04   0m
```

## View KD cluster details

We can retrieve the cluster details using the kubectl describe command.
For example:

```
kubectl describe KubeDirectorClusters ubuntu18.04
```

This shows:

```

```

## View KD cluster services

You can query the KubeDirector cluster services with the following:  `kubectl get services -l kubedirector.hpe.com/kdcluster=CLUSTERNAME`

For example:

```
kubectl get services -l kubedirector.hpe.com/kdcluster=ubuntu18.04
```

For me, this returns:

```
NAME             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
kdhs-q6nb9       ClusterIP      None            <none>        8888/TCP       4h49m
s-kdss-gpdft-0   LoadBalancer   10.101.174.78   <pending>     22:44823/TCP   4h49m
```

Because we are running on Minikube, the LoadBalancer type makes the Service accessible through the `minikube service` command.

```
minikube service s-kdss-gpdft-0
```

On my environment, this shows:

```
|-----------|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| NAMESPACE |      NAME      |  TARGET PORT   |          URL           |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| default   | s-kdss-gpdft-0 | generic-ssh/22 | http://10.0.2.15:44823 |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
ðŸŽ‰  Opening service default/s-kdss-gpdft-0 in default browser...
ðŸ‘‰  http://10.0.2.15:44823
```

We can now access the ssh service:

```
ssh 10.0.2.15 -p 44823
```

We are then prompted for a password:

```
The authenticity of host '[10.0.2.15]:44823 ([10.0.2.15]:44823)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:Dn6oo2QkGVHPKuyxZ4IsppQ5pdydwkJoWmtojnDC5Qo.

:::info no user for ssh
Note that we can't login yet because we haven't created a ssh user inside the container.
We will do that next.
:::

Let's create a user inside the container.  First let's find the pod:

```
kubectl get pods
```

Returns:

```
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kdss-gpdft-0                    1/1     Running   0          5h8m
kubedirector-7f9d95c9d5-mpw22   1/1     Running   0          5h8m
```

Pod `kdss-gpdft-0` looks like it is our pod, let's check:

```
kubectl describe pods kdss-gpdft-0 
```

Returns:

```
Name:         kdss-gpdft-0
Namespace:    default
Priority:     0
Node:         localhost.localdomain/10.0.2.15

```

We can see the label `kubedirector.hpe.com/kdcluster=ubuntu18.04`.  
Our kdcluster ID (Name) is `ubuntu18.04` so we know that `kdss-gpdft-0` is our ubuntu18.04 pod.


:::info find pod directly
As a shortcut in the future, we can find the pod for our kdcluster by name using:

```
kubectl get pods -l kubedirector.hpe.com/kdcluster=ubuntu18.04
```

Here we specify the name of our kdcluster: `ubuntu18.04`
:::


Let's login to the container using kubectl:

```
kubectl exec -it kdss-gpdft-0 -- /bin/bash
```

Which starts a bash session on the container:

```
root@kdss-gpdft-0:/# 
```

Let's create a user account:

```bash
root@kdss-gpdft-0:/# useradd demouser
root@kdss-gpdft-0:/# passwd demouser
Current Kerberos password: <Just press Enter key>
New password: P@55w0rd12345
Retype new password: P@55w0rd12345
...
You can now choose the new password or passphrase.
<Output truncated for brevity>
...
New password: P@55w0rd12345
Retype new password: P@55w0rd12345
Current Kerberos password: <Just press Enter key>
```

We can now exit the `kubectl exec` session, and ssh in as the `demouser`:

```
ssh demouser@10.0.2.15 -p 44823
```

and login:

```
demouser@10.0.2.15's password: P@55w0rd12345
```

You can now exit the SSH session.

## Delete KD cluster

We are finished with this exercise, so let's delete the cluster:

```
kubectl delete  KubeDirectorCluster ubuntu18.04
```

This should return:

```
kubedirectorcluster.kubedirector.hpe.com "ubuntu18.04" deleted
```

## Exercises

- Resize a cluster from one to two members (hint: see references, below).
  
:::note
You may need to [increase the size](/docs/lab/advanced) of your lab Virtual Machine for this exercise.
